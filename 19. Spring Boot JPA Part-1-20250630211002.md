# 19. Spring Boot JPA Part-1

**Application Logic : Basically a business logic for Application**

  

**JPA : Java Persistence API which is an interface, it is used to decide which ORM to be use.**

  

**HIBERNATE : It is an ORM & Implementation to JPA interface.**

  

**JDBC: It is an interface, which internally provides support to hibernate, JDBC it is an which is implemented by many deriver like postgres, mysql and many more.**

  

**Specific DB Driver: MYSQL : com.mysql.jdbc.Driver**

  

**Reational DB : MYSQL**

  

**ORM Framework:**

*   IT is a bridge between **JAVA** object and **RDBMS**

**Before going to JPA, let's recall JDBC**

  

**JAVA DATABASE CONNECTIVITY\[JDBC\] provide an iterface to:**

*   Make connection with DB
*   Query DB
*   and process the result

  

**Actual implementation is provided by Specific DB Drivers.**

  

For example:

  

**MySQL:**

*   Driver: Connector/J
*   Class : com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

  

**PostgresSQL:**

*   Driver : PostgresSQL JDBC Driver
*   Class : org.postgres.Driver

  

**H2 \[IN\_MEMOARY\]:**

*   Driver: H2 Database Engine
*   Class: org.h2.Driver

  
  

**Spring Boot without JDBC.**

**If we see above example:**

*   Connection
*   Statement
*   PreparedStatement
*   ResultSet etc.

All are interfaces which JDBC provide and each specific driver provide the implementation for it.

  

But there are so much of **BOILERCODE** present like:

*   Driver class loading
*   DB Connection Making
*   Exceptional Handling
*   Closing of the DB connection and other objects like Statements etc. IF not there is memoary leak
*   Manual handling of DB Connection Pool etc. JDBC CONNECTION Pool

**Driver class loading:**

JdbcTemplate load it at the time of application startup in DriverManager class.

  

**DB Connection Making:-**

*   jdbcTemplate takes care of it, whenever we execute any query.
*   it's handled by Connection con = DataSourceUtils.getConnection( this. obtainDataSource() );
*   Internally it's doGetConnection(dataSource);

  

**Exception Handling : -**

*   In Plain JDBC, we get very abstracted 'SQLException' but in jdbcTemplate, we get granular error like: DuplicateKeyException, QueryTimeoutException etc. (defined in org.springframework.dao package).
*   In this package we have multiple Exception like :
*   **CannotAcquireLockException**
*   **ConcurrencyFailureException**
*   **DataAccessException**
*   **DataAccessResourceFailureException**
*   **DataIntegrityViolationException**
*   **DataRetrivalFailureException**
*   **DuplicateKeyException**
*   **QueryTimeoutException**
*   **OptimsticLockingFailureException**

  

**Closing of the DB Connection and other resources.**

*   when we invoke update or query method, after success or failure of the operation, jdbcTemplates take care of either closing or return the connection to pool itself.
*   whether close the connection or put it back to the pool.

  

**Manual handling of DB Connection Pool-**

*   Spring boot provides default jdbc connection pool i.e. HikariCP with Min and Max pool size of 10.
*   we can change the configuration in [application.properties](http://application.properties)
*   spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10
*   spring.datasource.hikari.minimum-pool-idle=5

**BY Default Spring Boot uses Hkari DataSource.**

*   in configuration or application properties we are providing all details regarding driver, connection, url, username and password.
*   But we didn't mention the datasource part.
*   it's default Hikari datasource
*   Hikari datasource is also provide connection pool which is to be **HikariCP**

  

We can also configure different jdbc cpnnection pool if we want.
