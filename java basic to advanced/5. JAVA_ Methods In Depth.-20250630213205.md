# 5. JAVA: Methods In Depth.

**1\. What is Method.**

*   Method is used to perform certain task.
*   It is a collection of instruction that perform some specific task.
*   It can be used to bring the code readability and re-usability.

  

```java
public class calculation{
  public int sum(int a,int b){
    return a+b;
  }
  public int getPriceOfPen(){
   int capPrrice = 2;
   int penBodyPrice =5;
   int totalPenPrice = sum(capPrice,penBodyPrice);
   return totalPenPrice;    
  }
  
  public int getCombileAge(){
    int bro=10;
    int sis=20;
    return sum(bro+sis);
  }
}
```

  

**2\. Access Specifiers.**

 **public**: ➝ Can be access through any class and package.

 **private**: ➝Can be access by methods only in same class.

  

```java
//Invoking private method in same class.
public class Invoice{
  private void getInvoice(){
    System.out.println("Inside invoide method");  
  }
  public void printInvoice(){
    getInvoice();
  }
}
```

  

 **protected**: ➝  Can be access by other classes in the same 

Package or other sub-classes in different package \[**THROUGH INHERITANCE**\]

  

```java
//Invoking protected method in same Class. 
package Ecom;
public class Invoice{
  protected void getInvoice(){
  }
  public void printInvoice(){
    getInvoice();
  }
}
```

  

```java
//Invoking Protected method in same Package.
public class order{
  public void getOrderInvoice(){
    Invoice i = new Invoice();
    i.getInvoice();
  }
}
```

  

```java
//Try invoke protected method from 
//different Package.
package School;
import Ecom.Invoice;
public class Student{
  public void getStudentInvoice(){
    Invoice i = new Invoice();
    //protected method not accessable
    //in this current package.     
    i.getInvoice()//compile time error
  }
}
```

  

```java
//Through Inheritance
package HumanResource;
import Ecom.Invoice;
public class JobPortal extentds Invoice{
  public void getInvoiceForMaintaingPrtal(){
    Invoice i = ne Invoice();
    i.getInvoice();
  }
}
```

  

 **Default**: ➝ If we do not mention any thing, then Default access specifier is used in java. It can be only accessed by classes in same package .

```java
package Ecom;
public class Invoice{
  void getInvoice(){
    System.out.println("Inside invoide method");
  }
  public void printInvoice(){
    getInvoice();
  }
}
```

  

```java
//Through Inheritance try to invoke Default method of Invoice class. 
package HumanResource;
import Ecom.Invoice;
public class JobPortal extentds Invoice{
  public void getInvoiceForMaintaingPrtal(){
    Invoice i = ne Invoice();
    i.getInvoice();//compile time error
  }
}
```

  

**3\. Return Type.** 

*   After computation of method what ultimately going to return of which datatype either primitive or non-primitive.
*   void non return type

  

**4\. Method Name.**

*   It should be verb \[some kind of action\]
*   Should start with small letters and follow camel case of multiples words.

  

**5\. Parameters or Arguments .**

*   it's a list of variables that will be used int the method.
*   Parameter list can be blank too.

  

**6\. Method Throw Exception.**

  

```java
package Ecom;
public class Invoice{
  void getInvoice() throws Exception{
     System.out.println("Inside Invoice Method"); 
  }
  public void printInvoice() throw Exception{
    getInvoice()
  } 
}
```

  

**7\. System Define Method.**

*   Methods which are already defined and ready to use in java like Math.sqrt();

  

**8\. User Defined Methods.**

*   Method which Programmer create.

  

**9\. Overloaded Method .**

*   Method created more than once with same name but different parameters in same class.
*   Return type not to be consider.

```java
public class Cal{
   public int add(){
      return 10+20;
   }
   public int add(int a,int b){
     return a+b;
   } 
   String add(int a,int b,int c){
   }
      
}
```

  

**10\. Overridden Methods .**

*   Subclass has the same method as the parent class.
*   Method signature should be same.

  

```scala
class Person{ 
    private void profession(){
        System.out.println("I am Person");
    }
}
class Engineer extends Person{
    private void profession(){
        System.out.println("I am Engineer");
    }
}
```

  

```java
Person p = new Person();
p.profession();// I am Person
Person personEngineer = new Engineer();
personEngineer.profession();// I am Engineer
```

  

```scala
class Person{ 
  public void profession(){
    System.out.println("I am Person");
  }

}
//After extending we can not make public to private in overridden method
class Engineer extends Person{
   private void profession(){ //compile time error
      System.out.println("I am Engineer");
   }
}
```

  

> **ERROR**: ➝'profession()' in '[MethodsInDepth.Engineer](http://MethodsInDepth.Engineer)' clashes with 'profession()' in 'MethodsInDepth.Person'; attempting to assign weaker access privileges ('private'); was 'public'

  

```java
class Person{
  private void profession(){
    System.out.println("I am Person");
  }
}
//After extendending we can make private to public in overriden method
class Engineer extends Person{
  public void profession(){
   System.out.println("I am Engineer");
  }
}
```

  

```java
class Person{
  protected void profession(){
   System.out.println("I am Person");
  }
}
//After extendending we can not make protected to private in overriden method
class Engineer extends Person{
   private void profession(){//comiple time error
     System.out.println("I am Engineer");
   }
}
```

  

**11\. Static Method Java .**

*   These methods are associated with the class.
*   can be call just with class name.
*   Static methods can not access Non Static Instance variables and methods.

  

```java
public class Calculation{
  int stockPrice = 30;
  static int carPrice = 49;  

  public static int calculatePrice(){
    carPrice = 50;
    //non - static instance is not accesable. method are associated with class.
    //which is common for all objects of class If we are try to modify non - static 
    //Variable then there is a confusion which object variable is going to be modify
    //Wether it is Obj1, obj2 and so on. That's Why we can able not access it.
   
    stockPrice = 20;//compile time error.

    //Because it is non-static method.
    print()//compile time error;     
  }
  
  public int print(){
    System.out.println("I am non-static method");
  }   
}
```

*   Static method can not be overridden.
*   Method overridden is decide by objects which method to call, Either from parent or child, And it is decide at run time.
*   In case Of Static method it's already been common for all objects which is done at compile time.
*   Static Method Can be overloaded.

  

**11.1 When to Declare method Static:**

*   Methods which do not modify the state of the object can be declared as static.
*   Utility Method Which do not use any instance variable and

       compute only one arguments

  

**Static method Examples: Factory Design Pattern depends only on Argument.**

  

```java
Class A{
  void method1(){
    System.out.println("Member Level Method.");
  }
  static void method2(){
    System.out.println("Static method Method.");
  }

}
```

  

```java
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    A obj1 = new A();
    A obj2 = new A();
    obj1.method1();
    obj2.method1();
    A.method2()//static method calling by class name.
  }
}
```

**12\. Final Method .** 

*   Final method can not be overridden in java.
*   Why? final method means its implementation can not be changed. If child class can not change it's implementation then no use of overridden.

**13\. Abstract Method.**

*   It is defined only in Abstract classes.
*   Only Method declaration.
*   It's implementation is done in child class;

  

```php
public abstract class Person{
  public final void profession(){
    System.out.println("Hi i am in Final profession 
    method of person abstract class.");
  }
  public abstract int print(int val);
}
public class Doctor extends Person{
  @Override
  public int print(int val){
    return val;
  }
}
```

  

**14\. Variable Arguments \[ VARARGS \]**

*   Variable number of inputs in the parameter.
*   Only one variable argument can be present in the method.
*   It should be the last argument in the list.

  

```java
public static int sum(int ...variables){
  int sum=0;
  for(int var:variables){
    sum=sum+var;
  }
  return sum;
}
System.out.println(sum(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9));
```

  

> **public static int sum(int ...variables, int ...variables2)//****wrong**

  

```java
public static int sum(String str,int ...variables){
  int sum=0;
  System.out.println(str);
  for(int var:variables){
    sum=sum+var;
  }
  return sum;
}
System.out.println(sum("Saurav Saxena",1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9));


```
