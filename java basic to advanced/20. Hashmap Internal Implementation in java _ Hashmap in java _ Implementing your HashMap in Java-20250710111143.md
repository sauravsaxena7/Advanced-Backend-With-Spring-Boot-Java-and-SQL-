# Hashmap Internal Implementation in java | Hashmap in java | Implementing your HashMap in Java

**Map<Integer,String> mp = new Hasmap<>();**

**mp.put(1,"saurav");**

*   Default size\[16\]

➝it always in 2 pow( 0,1,2,3,4,56)

➝\[2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^5...\]

➝ For less collision.

*   when we apply put function with key value pair. Internally for corresponding key a HASH CODE will be generated from that HASH CODE and index is obtained, on that particular index a linked list for each and every key value pair which is store in the form Node\[key, value, next\]

Why Maximum capacity of hash map is 1<<30

```cpp
 private static final int MAXIMUM_CAPACITY = 1<<30;
```

  

*   Integer size 4 byte
*   1byte = 8 bit's
*   4byte = 32 bit's
*   range for the same -2^31 to 2^31-1
*   1 bit is for signed bit
*   Hash map size always 2 to the power something
*   could we take Hash Map Size = 2^31 ???.
*   You can maximum take 2^31 -1 but hash map size always in 2^ something
*   So, we can not take 2^31-1 as maximum size .
*   We have to take 2^30 as max size of hash map.

  

**Is user want's to define custom capacity for Hash map.**

let's size=4

\>>> unsigned right shift operator

*   Most significant bit is used as signed bit
*   on positive number there is no difference between in >>> and >>, both act the same.
*   \>> when we work with right shift operator it does not touches the signed bit or Most significant bit , it always work with rest of bit.
*   \>>> Unsigned right shift operator consider Most significant bit or signed bit .

  

**MUJHE SAMJH ME NHI AYA HAIN** >>>unsigned right shift operator

let's capacity = 7 =2^3 = cap

*   so we need to find in 2^ \[pow\]

7=>

| 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

cap = cap-1=>6

| 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

*   here taking capacity =7 and doing cap -1 it doesn't make much difference.
*   Here we have 7 and we want make it in the form of 2^3 which is 8.
*   Here we are doing cap -1 because we want to make most significant bit is 0

  

For better understanding let's take example of

Capacity = cap=15

| 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

  

n=cap-1 = 14

| 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

n |= n>>>1 => n= n | n>>>1

  

n= 14

| 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

n>>>1 = 7

| 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

OR OPERATION BETWEEN \[n=n | n>>>1\]

|  | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| N | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| N>>>1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| **OR operation** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

AND NEW n= 15

| 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |

**Contract B/W Hash code and Equals**

**Hash code**

*   If one or same object or key , it doesn't matter how many time we are gonna apply hashcode(), value always will be the same.
*   If we have different object's or key it could return same hashcode value. \[May or May not be\]

  

**Equals**

*   obj1==obj2 ➝ hashcode always same.
*   obj1 != obj2 ➝hashcode could be the same

  

**What ever the method we are using to find hash code in our current program there is lot's of chances for collision.**

  

In java HashMap

```plain
/**
 * Computes key.hashCode() and spreads (XORs) higher bits of hash
 * to lower.  Because the table uses power-of-two masking, sets of
 * hashes that vary only in bits above the current mask will
 * always collide. (Among known examples are sets of Float keys
 * holding consecutive whole numbers in small tables.)  So we
 * apply a transform that spreads the impact of higher bits
 * downward. There is a tradeoff between speed, utility, and
 * quality of bit-spreading. Because many common sets of hashes
 * are already reasonably distributed (so don't benefit from
 * spreading), and because we use trees to handle large sets of
 * collisions in bins, we just XOR some shifted bits in the
 * cheapest possible way to reduce systematic lossage, as well as
 * to incorporate impact of the highest bits that would otherwise
 * never be used in index calculations because of table bounds.

static final int hash(Object key) {
    int h;
    return (key == null) ? 0 : (h = key.hashCode()) ^ (h >>> 16);
}
```

  

**& \[Bitwise AND\]**

here three 0 and one 1

  

**➝ | \[Bitwise OR\]**

here three times 1 and one times 0

  

**➝ ^ \[Bitwise XOR\]**

here two times come 0 and again two times comes 1

so, Probability increases as compare to \[and\], \[or\]

So, Probability is 1/2

so collision will decreases.

  

**Load Factor 0.75f;**

*   hash map capacity full by 75% then we are going resize our hash map.

  
  

**TREEIFY\_THRESHOLD :**

*   in java 8 if linked list node count increases to 8 or more
*   Worst case time complexity O(N)
*   the linked list converted into **balanced binary tree or red black tree**
*   Worst case time complexity O(log N)

```cpp
/**
 * The bin count threshold for using a tree rather than list for a
 * bin.  Bins are converted to trees when adding an element to a
 * bin with at least this many nodes. The value must be greater
 * than 2 and should be at least 8 to mesh with assumptions in
 * tree removal about conversion back to plain bins upon
 * shrinkage.
