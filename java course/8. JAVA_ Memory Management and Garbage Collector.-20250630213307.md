# 8. JAVA: Memory Management and Garbage Collector.

_By Saurav Saxena._

  

**1\. What is Memory Management ?** 

**2\. Types of Memory.**

*   STACK
*   HEAP

**➝Both Stack and Heap are created by JVM and stored in RAM.**

  

> **Generally Heap has more memory than Stack.**

  

**3\. Stack Memory.**

*   Store Temporary variables and separate memory block for methods.

```java
//block or temporary variables.
{
  int a = 10;
}
```

*   Store Primitive data types.
*   **Store reference** of the heap objects.

   ➝ Strong reference

   ➝When garbage collector runs strong reference object not get's deleted.

```java
//Strong reference
Person obj = new Person();
```

  

*   **Weak reference**

     ➝When garbage collector runs it deletes the weak reference object.

  

\*\*\*Soft reference\*\*\*

*   soft reference is a type of weak reference .
*   In that case when garbage collector runs soft reference object tells that hey! GC Only delete me when it's very very urgent.

```java
//Weak Reference 
WeakReference<Person> weakObj = new WeakReference<Person>(new Person());
```

*   Each thread has it's own Stack Memory but it shares same common heap memory.
*   Variables within a SCOPE is only visible and as soon as any variables goes out of the SCOPE, it's get deleted from Stack \[ In LIFO order \].
*   When Stack memory goes full, it's throws

**"java.lang.StackOverflowError"**

  

```typescript
class Person{ 
    protected void profession(){
        System.out.println("I am Person");
    }
}
public class MemoryManagement{
    
    //main() method
    public static void main(String args[]){
        int primitiveVariable1 = 10;
        Person personObj = new Person();
        String stringLiterals = "24";
        MemoryManagement memObj = new MemoryManagement();
        memObj.memoryManagementTest(personObj);
    }

    //memoryManagementTest() method
    private void memoryManagementTest(Person person){
        Person testPersonObj=person;
        String stringLiterals2 = "24";
        String str = new String("24");
    }
}
```

*   When **memoryManagementTest method** scope got closing bracket.
*   In Stack memory **memoryManagementTest method** scope also got deleted as well as reference is also disconnected from heap memory in **LAST IN FIRST OUT \[LIFO\]** Manner.
*   After deleting scope of  **memoryManagementTest method** code execution encounter closing bracket of **main() method** scope, and **main method scope** is also got deleted from **Stack memory** as well as it's reference is also got disconnected from **heap memory**.
*   Apart from that we have seen all reference of **Stack memory** to **Heap memory** it's get's disconnected.
*   But all the **objects** and **String Pool constant literals** are still there in **heap memory** .
*   And this is a serious problem,
*   To resolve this problem **GARBAGE COLLECTOR**  comes into picture.

  

**4\. Garbage Collector.**

*   It is used to delete the un-referenced Object from the heap.
*   Garbage collector runs periodically and JVM Controls it.
*   JVM Controls When to run garbage collector.
*   System.gc() to run garbage collector manually.
*   Garbage Collector scan the heap memory if it find any obj area which has not any referenced it will be deleted by garbage collector.
*   If you write System.gc() in java code there is no guarantee JVM will run the garbage collector.

  

**Multiple Way to invoking Garbage Collector.**

```java
//Way to Invoking Garbage collector
Person p = new Person();
p=null;
Person p1 = new Person();
Person p2 = new Person();
//here p1 refrencing obj got disconnected //and GC will soon delete it.
p2=p1;
//When Heap memoary is going to full then //garbage collectors call.
```

  

**5\. Heap Memory .**

*   Store Objects.
*   There is no order of allocating the memory.
*   Garbage Collector is used to delete the un-referenced objects from the heap.

  ➝ Mark and Sweep Algorithm with Compaction.

     ➝Compaction helps to organize object into sequential manner.

**How Memory Compation work's see figure below.**

  **Types of GC:**

**➝Serial GC**

*   In case of Serial GC one thread working for **Minor GC** and one thread working for **Major GC**.

**DisAdvantage:-**

*   Application  Slow \[ Pausing Too Many times \]
*   **GC** is very expensive

➝ Whenever **GC** Works Start All application thread will get's PAUSE.

**➝Parallel GC**

*   Multiple thread working for **GC** in Parallel but still there is a pause in application

  

**➝CMS \[ Concurrent Mark & Sweep \]**

*   While your Application Thread are working concurrently GC Thread are also working.
*   JVM Not give 100% guarantee that your application is not going to pause.
*   JVM Try to do best concurrent but it's not give 100% guarantee.
*   There is No Memory Compaction Happens.

  

**➝G1 Garbage Collector.**

*   **G1 Garbage collector** gives 100% guarantee to not pause in application and there is memory compaction happens.
*   All the freed up memory appended in last after memory compaction.
*   Throughput Increases Let's say:➝1000 request/sec or min.
*   **Latency** Decreases. Threads are not pausing 

  

*   Heap Memory is shared with all the threads.
*   Heap also contains the String Pool.
*   When Heap memory goes full, it's throws

   **"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError"**

*   Heap memory is further divided into:

   ➝ Young Generation \[ Minor GC happens Here \] 

       ➝ Eden

       ➝Survivor

       ➝Old/ Tenured Generation

                       **\[ Major GC happens here \]**

  ➝ Permanent Generation \[MetaSpace\].

           ➝bEfore Java 7 it was part of Heap memory

           ➝ is separated from Heap Memory

*   **_PermGen (Permanent Generation)_** _is a special heap space separated from the_ **_main memory_** _heap. The_ **_JVM_** _keeps track of loaded_ **_class metadata_** _in the_ **_PermGen_**_. Additionally, the_ **_JVM_** _stores all the static content in this memory section._
*   _Currently known as_ **_MEATSPACE_**

  

**➝ MetaSpace**

*   Stores Class variables
*   Stores Constant \[ static final \]
*   Store Class Meta data

  

*   How Objects Store In Heap Memory and it's Internal Working Step Explain I below **Diagram**.
