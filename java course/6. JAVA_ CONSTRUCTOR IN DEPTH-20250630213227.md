# 6. JAVA: CONSTRUCTOR IN DEPTH

_By Saurav Saxena._

  

1. **What is Constructor.**
*   Is is used to create an instance;
*   It's Similar to method expect:
*   Name: Constructor name is same as Class Name.
*   It is easy to identify as a constructor.
*   Return Type: Constructor do not have any return type.
*   Implicitly Java add return type as class that's we don't need to mention it again.   
*   Constructor can not be static , final , abstract and synchronized.
*   **Final** : ➝ We are applying final over method so inherited

                         or child class can not override that method.

                 ➝  In case of Constructor it can not be overridden so

                          does not make any sense to make it final

*   **Abstract**: ➝An abstract method need implementation 

                             by inherited class.

                      ➝ In case of constructor it can not be inherited from it's parent class

                           and that's for we can't provide any implementation to abstract 

                           constructor by it's child or inherited class so, that's why it's not 

                           possible to make a constructor an abstract.

*   **Static**: ➝ Constructor used to initialize the Objects.

                 ➝ If constructor is static we can not able access Instance variable

                      of class and after that objects not get's initialized by constructor.

                ➝ we cannot use super in child class to call constructor.

```java
class Employee{
  int empId; 
  //Here we can create method same name as class
  public String Employee(String str){
    return str;
  }   
}
```

  

```java
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
     //here new keyword not creating instance 
     //It's tells JVM TO call constructor .
     //after calling constructor a new
     //instance will be created as well as
     //Initialized
     Employee obj = new Employee();
     String str = obj.Employee("Saurav");
     System.out.println(str);
  }
}
```

  
  

**2\. Type Of Constructor.**

*   Default Constructor.
*   No Argument or Args Constructor \[user defined\]

  

```java
public class Calculation{
  String name;
  //No Args Constructor.   
  Calculation(){
    name=null;
  }   
}
```

  

*   Parameterized Constructor

```java
public class A{
  String name;
  A(String name){
    this.name=name;
  }  
}
```

  

```java
//If we are adding any manual constructor
//default constructor not added in .class file
//we need to call a constructor as per
//it's defination in class.
A a = new A();//compile time error 
```

*   Constructor overloading
*   Private constructor

```java
//singleton design pattern
//return only one object;
//outside of class object creation is not possible
public class Calculation{
  String name;
  int empId;  
  private Calculaton(){    
  }
  public static Calculation getInstance(){
    return new Calulation();
  }
}
```

  

**2.1 Constructor Chaining**

*   One practical use case is to avoid duplication of code. Let's say parent constructor

    is already doing some task, then child constructor don't have to do

    all the stuff again, it can simply call super().

*   this  - Only Within the class chaining is possible.

```java
//Example of constructor chainng
public class Employee{
  String name;
  int empId;
  Employee(){
    this(10);
  }

  Employee(int empId){   
   this(empId,"Saurav Saxena")    
  }  
  Employee(int empId, String name){
    this.empId = empId;
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

  

**2.3 Super**

```java
public class Person{
  int id;
  Person(int id){
    this.id=id;     
    System.out.println("This is Person Class: no Arg");
  }
}
public class Manager extends Person{  
  String name;
  Manager(int id, String name){
     super(id);
     this.name = name;   
    //super()//hidden super method calling it's parent
    System.out.println("This is manager class : no arg");
  }
}
//bootom to up calling.
//first calling it's parent constructor 
//then manager calling own constructor.
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Manager m = new Manager(1001,"SAURAV");
  }
}
output:
This is Person Class: no Arg
This is manager Class: no Arg
```
