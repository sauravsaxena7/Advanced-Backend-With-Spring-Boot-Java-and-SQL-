# 14. JAVA: INTERFACE IN DEPTH.

_By Saurav Saxena._

  

1\. What is Interface.

\->Interface is something which helps 2 system to interact with each other. without one system has to know the details of other.

\->Or In simple term I can say it helps to achieve ABSTRACTION.

2.  Interface declaration Consist Of.

\->Modifiers.

\->"interface" keyword

\->Interface Name

\->Comma separated list of parent interfaces.

\->Body

> Only PUBLIC and Default Modifiers are allowed \[PROTECTED AND PRIVATE ARE NOT ALLOWED\]

  

```plain
public interface Bird{
  public void fly();
}
interface Animal{
  public void run();
}
public interface LivingThing extends Bird,Animal{
  public void eat();
}
```

3\. Why we need Interface.

3.1. Abstraction\[100%\]:

\->Using Interface, We can achieve full Abstraction means, we can define WHAT class must do, but not How it will do.

```typescript
public class Eagle implements Bird{
   @Override
   public void fly(){
     System.out.println("Eagle Is Flying");
   }
}
```

3.2 . Polymorphism:

\->Interface can used to as a Data Type.

\->We can not created the Object of an interface, but it can hold the reference of all the classes which implements it , and at runtime, it decided which method needs to be invoked.

```typescript
public class Men implements Bird{
   @Override
   public void fly(){
     System.out.println("Men can not fly");
   }
}
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Bird birdObjEagle = new Eagle();
    Bird birdObjMen = new Men();
    birdObjMen.fly();
    birdObjEagle.fly();
  }
}
output:
Eagle is flying
Men can not fly
```

3.3 . Multiple Inheritance:

\->In java Multiple inheritance is possible only through interface only.

  

3.4. Diamond Problem.

\->

```typescript
public class WaterAnimal{
  public boolean canBreathe(){
    return true;
  }
}
public class Animal{
  public boolean canBreath(){
    return true;
  }
}
//compile time error
public class Crocodile extends LandAnimal,WaterAnimal{
  
}
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Crocodile obj = new Crocodile();
    //obj get's confused which method to call whether it is WaterAnimal or LandAnimal
    obj.canBreath();
  }
}
```

Multiple Inheritance Support through Interfaces.

```plain
public interface LandAnimal{
  public boolean canBreadth();
}
public interface WaterAnimal{
  public boolean canBreadth();
}
public class Crocodile implements LandAnimal,WaterAnimal{
  @Override
  public boolean canBreadth(){
    return true;
  }
}
public class Main{ 
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Crocodile obj = new Crocodile();
    Syatem.out.println(obj.canBreath());
  }
}
output:
true
```

  

4\. Methods In Interface.

\->All Methods are implicit public only.

\->Method can not be declared as final.

\->interface contain only signature and declaration of body.

  

5\. Fields In Interfaces.

\->Fields are public, static and final implicitly \[CONSTANTS\]

\->You can not make field private or protected.

```plain
public interface Bird{
  //Both are equal  
  int MAX_HEIGHT_IN_FEET = 2000;
  public static final int MAX_HEIGHT_IN_FEET = 2000;
}
```

6\. Interfaces Implementation and Rules.

\->Overriding method can not have more restrict access modifiers .

\->Concrete class must override all the methods declared int the interface.

\->Abstract classes are not forced to override all the methods.

\->A class can implement from multiple interfaces.

```cpp
public class Eagle implements Bird{
  //Commple time error
  //you cannot restrict the access 
  //it has to be public
modifier's
  @Override
  protected void fly(){
    //do something
  }
}
```

 EXAMPLE of Abstract class implementation of interface.

```plain
public interface{
  public void canFly();
  public void noOfWings();
}
//abstract class not forced to be Override //all methods of interface.
//there is no implementation for //noOfWings()
public abstract class Eagle implements Bird{
  @Override
  public void canFly(){
    //Implementation goes here.
  }
  public abstract void breakLength();
}
//In concrete class if any abstract method 
//which needs implementation, need to 
//implement here forced.
public class WhiteEagle extends Eagle{
  @Override
  public void noOfWings(){
    //do something here
  }
  
  @Override
  public void beakLength(){
  }
}
```

7\. Nested Interfaces.

\->Nested Interface declared within another interface.

\-> Nested Interface declared within a class.

\->Generally it's used to group, logical related interfaced. And nested interface.

RULES:

\->Anested interface declared within an interface must be public.

\->A nested interface declared within a class can have any access modifiers.

\->When you implement outer interface, inner interface implementation is not required and vice versa.

  

```typescript
//In interface nested interface should be public only.
//
public interface Bird{
  public void canFly();
  public interface NonFlyingBird{
    public void canRun();
  }
}
//here there is no need for implementation
//of Nested interface
public class Eagle implements Bird{
  @Override
  public void canFly(){
  }
}
//It's only need to provide implementation
//for Nested Interface
public class Eagle implements Bird.NonFlyingBird{
  @Override
  public void canRun(){
  }
}
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Bird.NonFlyingBird obj = new Eagle();
    obj.canRun();
  }
}
public class Eagle implement Bird, Bird.NonFlyingBird{
  @Override 
  public void canRun(){
  }
  @Override 
  public void canFly(){
  }
}
```

Example of nested Interface IN class itself.

\->

```plain
//class have member's and member's can be
//public, protected and private
public class Bird{
  protected interface NonFlyingBird{
    public void canRun();
  }
}
public class Eagle implements Bird.NonFlyingBird{
  @Override 
  public void canRun(){
  }
}
```

8\. Difference Between Abstract classes and interfaces.

ABSTRACT CLASS:

\->Keyword used here is "abstract"

\->Child classes needs to use keyword "extend"

\->It can have both abstract and non abstract method.

\->It can extend from Another class and multiple interfaces.

\->Variables can be static , non-static, final, non-final etc.

\->Variables and methods can be private, protected, public and default.

\->Multiple Inheritance is not supported.

\->It can provide the implementation of the interface.

\->It can have Constructor

\->To declare abstract method , we have to use keyword 

"abstract" keyword and it can be protected public and private too.

  

INTERFACES:

\->Keyword used here is "interface"

\->Child classes needs to use keyword "implements"

\->It can have  only abstract method.

    ->\[ from Java8 onwards it can have default, static, and private methods too, where we can provide implementation.\]

\->It can only extend from Another Interfaces.

\->Variables are by default  CONSTANT.

\->Variables and methods are by default public.

\[in java 9 private method is supported\]

\->Multiple Inheritance supported with this in java.

\->it can not provide implementation of any other interface and abstract class.

\->It can not have constructor.

\->No need for any keyword to make method abstract, and by defaults it is public.

  

9\. \[JAVA 8 AND JAVA 9 Features\].

9.1. Default Method\[JAVA8\].

\->Before Java 8, interface can have only Abstract method. And all child classes has to provide abstract method implementation.

\->When we are introducing some new method in interface . All child classes which implements that interface needs to provide new method implementation

although it's core functionality will be the same.

  

```plain
public interface Bird{
  public void canFly();
  //Introducing new Method their 
  //core functionality will be the same.
  public int getMinimumFlyHeight();
}
public class Eagle implements Bird{
  @Override
  public void canFly(){
  }
  @Override
  public int getMinimumFlyHeight(){
    return 100;
  }
}
public class Sparrow implements Bird{ 
  @Override
  public void canFly(){
  }
  @Override
  public int getMinimumFlyHeight(){
    return 100;
  }
}
```

SOLUTION:

```plain
public interface Bird{ 
  public void canFly();
  default int getMinimumFlyHeight(){
    return 100;
  }
}
```

9.2 Why default method was introduced.

\->To add functionality in existing Leagcy interface we need to use default method.

\->Example stream() method in Collection interface.

  

10\. Default and Multiple Inheritance, How to handle.

\->

```plain
public interface Bird {
  default boolean canBreath(){
    return true;
  }
}
public interface LivingThing{ 
  default boolean canBreath(){
    return true;
  }
}
//Multiple Ineritance with same name //default method 
//compile time error
public class Eagle implements Bird,LivingThing{ 
}
public class Eagle implements Bird,LivingThing{
  public boolean canBreathe(){
    return true;
  }
}
```

11 . Default method when an interface extend another interface.

\->There  are 3 way.

11.1. FIRST WAY.

```plain
public interface LivingThing{
  default boolean canBreadth(){
    return true;
  }
}
public interface Bird extends LivingThing{
  
}
public class Eagle implements Bird{
}
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Eagle eagleObj = new Eagle();
    eagleObj.canBreadth();
  }
}
```

11.2. Second Way.

\->

```plain
public interface LivingThing{ 
  default boolean canBreadth(){
    return true;
  }
}
public interface Bird extends LivingThing{
  boolean canBreadth();
}
//comile time error
//we need to provide implementation for //abstract method.
public class Eagle implements Bird{
  
}
public class Eagle implements Bird{
  @Override
  public boolean canBreadth(){
     return true;
  }
}
```

11.3 Third Way.

\->

```typescript
public interface LivingThing{ 
  default boolean canBreadth(){
    return true;
  }
}
public interface Bird extends LivingThing{
  @Overriding 
  default boolean canBreadth(){
    boolean canBreadthOrNot = LivingThing.super.canBreadth();
    return canBreadthOrNot;
  }
}
```

  

12\. Static Method In \[JAVA 8\].

\->we can provide implementation of the method in interface.

\->But it can not be overridden by classes which implement the interface.

\->We can access it using Interface name itself.

\->It's by default public.

  

```typescript
public interface Bird{
  static boolean canBreadth(){
    return true;
  } 
}
public class Eagle implements Bird{
  public void digestiveSystemTestMethod(){
    if(Bird.canBreadth()){
       
    }
  }
}
```

> Default method can be overrides but not STATIC ONE.

13 . Private method and private static method JAVA 9.

\->We can provide the implementation of method but as private access modifiers in interface.

\->It brings more readability of the code. For Example it multiple default method share some code, than  this can help.

\->It can defined as static and not-static.

\->From Static method, we can call only private static interface method.

\->Private static method, can be called from both static and non-static method.

\->Private static method can not be abstract. means we have to provide definition.

\->private method or private static method It can be used inside of the particular interface only.

  

```typescript
public interface Bird{
  //this is equivalent to 
  //public abstract void canFly();
  void canFly();
  public default void minimumFlyingHeight(){
    myStaticPublicMethod();//calling static method
    myPrivateMethod();//calling Private
    myPrivateStaticMethod()// calling
  } 

  static void myStaticPublicMethod(){
    //from static we can call other static method only.
    myPrivateStaticMethod();
    priavte void myPrivateMethod(){
      //implementation here
    }
    private static void myPrivateStaticMethod(){
       //implementation
    }
  }  
}
```
