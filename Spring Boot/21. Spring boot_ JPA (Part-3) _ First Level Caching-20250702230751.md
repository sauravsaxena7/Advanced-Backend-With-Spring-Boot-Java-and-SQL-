*   when [userRepos.save](http://userRepos.save)(user) → it's internally call entityManager.persist(user) → follow by hibernate implementation class called sessionImpl
*   In sessionImpl class a persistence context created for corresponding entitiy object and first that user entity object hold by **persistence context** that's called **first level of caching**.
*   apart from this, when **transaction committed**, then user record will in actual **DB** and **flush()** the context as per life cycle.

*   After persist you trying to fetch the data, in this case you are dealing with same entity Manager, which aware of same persistence context, so it's not call directly to DB it's first checked the data is present in current context, if present, then no select query going to executed.
*   now the question is arises, **How the same entity manager is used ?**
*   You now the dispatcher servlet, it is the first controller, so in the dispatcher servlet there is something called API **preHandle()** before it actually invokes.
*   this preHandle(), during application startup, it's created entityManagerFactory();
*   so, at the httpservelet request hitting first controller called dispacher servlet called preHandled() method,
*   in pre handled method it's obtain entityManager factory.
*   for that corresponding entityManager factory it's creates entityManager(), for each http request.
