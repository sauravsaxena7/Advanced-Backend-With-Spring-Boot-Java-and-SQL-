# 22. Spring boot: JPA (Part-4) | Second Level Caching

  

**Dis-Advantages of first level of caching.**

*   when ever you making **HTTP** Request a new entity manager created with new persistence context.
*   If you making a get call for an user with id 1, you repetitive making http calls it's always makes new entity manager with new **persistence context**, these persistence context is totally new for every request, so, they don't have any previous entity cache so, that's why every time they always call to **DB** for fetching data , the always going to execute **select** query.

**Now, in Second Level caching or L2 caching, we will achieve something like this:**

**Let's first see happy flow, and see what all it takes to enable the 2nd level of caching.**

*   In 2nd level of caching scenarios for every request it's first check in persistence context, if entity not found, after wards it's check for L2 cache

**Encache**

*   So there are multiple cache each cache like caffine, Hazelcast, and Encache
*   encache one of the implementation for JCache APIs Interface.
*   it is just a provider for 2nd level of caching.

  
  

**Cache-API**

*   This is like a interface.
*   It exposes all the API let's say get cache, create cache etc.
*   we are just interested in invoking these api which is implement provider like encache.

  

**Hibernate-jcache**

*   Hibernate cannot talks directly to Jcache-Api , and there are many annotations like @Cache, @CacheConcurrencyStratgey, those are understand by **hibernate-Jcache**.
*   so, it's a bridge between **HIbernate** and **JCache-APIs.**
*   every annotation adding for caching, this understand it.
*   Hibernate knows how to talks to Hibernate-Jcache .
*   Hibernate cannot call directly put cache, create cache and get cache. But hibernate-Jcache know how resolve it.
*   Cache stratgey like read-write and read-only, it also handled by **hibernate-Jcache.**

**use\_second\_level\_cache=true**

*   this enable second level of caching.

  

first understand **region**

  

**Region**

*   Helps in logical grouping of cached data.
*   for each region or say group, we can apply different caching strategey like:

→Eviction policy:→ LIFO, FIFO, LRU→Least recently used

→ TTL time to live for cached data.

→cache size

→Concurrency stratgey etc.

  

Which helps in acheiving granular level management of cached data (either Entity, Collection or Query results)

**Region.factory\_class**

*   who is going to manage that Jcahe region factory?
*   Hibernate-Jcache aslo has factory and Encache also has factory class.
*   if you want to directly work with encache managing all the cache direcly.
*   but it's always a better approach to use Hibernate-Jcache for region factory, in future you want to change encache provider hazelCache or caffeine then you don't need to work or change with lot's of code.

  

**Cache provider:**

*   Spring needs to tell the cache provider.
*   Even though we are adding cache dependency in pom.xml

**L2 comes in the picture when you do first get calls**

**→In case of update rollback, the flag invalidate not removed from cache, just release the lock only.**

**→when get call comes first it's check for invalidate cache, if it is there, then it's first read from DB then update the cache with latest data and then remove invalidate cache flag.**

  

**on successful transaction**

*   release the lock.
*   update the cache data with newly fresh DB updated data.
*   and remove the invalidate cache.

**NONSTRICT\_READ\_WRITE.**

**For Successful commits**

*   update happens it's going to acquire any lock, it's simply begin transaction, after succesful commits with updated data.
*   it's change the flag to invalidate cache. and release the lock from cache.
*   it's not going to update data in cache with fresh newly updated data.

  
  

**For Rollback**

*   it won't do anything, it's not going to do invalidate the cache.
*   Simply release the lock.
