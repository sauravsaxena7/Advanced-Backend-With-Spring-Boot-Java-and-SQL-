# 20. JPA PART 2 in depth

  
  
  

**ORM (Object - Relational Mapping )**

*   Act as a bridge between Java Object and Database tables.
*   Unlike JDBC, where we have to work with SQL, with this, we can interact with database using Objects.

  

→ By default JPA uses as it's implementation is Hibernate.

→But if you want to use different, definitely you can like **OPEN JPA** OR **ECLIPSELINK** instead of hibernate as the implementation of JPA.

  
  

**Let's first see, 1 Happy flow first, before deep dive into JPA**

*   When you create new Entity object like new UserDetails(), it's equivalent to one row in a database table.
*   In UserDetailsRepository it's extends JpaRepository<UserDetails,Long>, it's an interface and expose APIs to insert, get , modify etc.
*   Some times we have to write your own query in JPQL, HQL,

  

**To enable the console, we can add, below two properties in "**[**application.properties**](http://application.properties)**"**

  

spring.h2.consoled.enabled=true

spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console;

  

[http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)

*   Your console will open and there you can see the details.

→ While inserting data you are not able to see query of select , you only see the query of insert query, it's because Hibernate do first level of caching that we will see later. Internally it does fetch the data.

  

**JPA Architecture / Components involved**

1. **Persistence Unit**
*   Logical grouping of Entity classes which share same configurations.
*   let's one group contains \[e1, e2, .... e100\] entity goes to MySQL DB.
*   let's another group contains \[e1, e2, .... e100\] entity goes to PostgresDB.
*   Configuration details like:
*   Database connection properties.
*   JPA provider (hibernate etc.)

**transaction-type = "RESOURCE\_LOCAL"**

*   If you have more than one DB then one transaction\[begin,commit\] is related to corresponding DB1 only.
*   if you want to use multiple DB, then you used JTA, but we will see.

  

→IN Spring BOOt we don't need to create persistance.xml

  
  

**2\. EntityManagerFactory**

*   Using Persistence Unit Configuration, EntityManagerFactory object get created during application startup.
*   if any property is not provided, default one is picked and set.
*   1 EntityManagerFactory for 1 persistence unit.
*   This class act as a factory to create an object of EntityManager.

**3\. Transaction Manager association with EntityManagerFactory**

  

Transaction manager could be of 2 type:

*   Manager, which managing transaction for 1 DB
*   Manager, which managing transaction which can span across multiple DB. That's also possible using JTA.

  

*   During persistence unit, we have specified the value for **"transaction-type"** value either:
*   **RESOURCE\_LOCAL** (default)
*   For every persistence unit → one EntityManagerFactory → one transaction manager for one DB only.

*   **_JTA_** (Java Transaction API

  

![](https://t9016373936.p.clickup-attachments.com/t9016373936/05676177-028a-4668-9657-275b70f00b88/image.png)

*   One transaction manager for two DB H2 and MySQL

  
  

**During application startup, after EntityManagerFactory object created, based on RESOURCE\_LOCAL or JTA, transaction manager object get started**

**4\. EntityManager and Persistence Context.**

*   Its an interface in JPA that provides methods to perform CRUD operations on entities.
*   persist() for saving
*   merge() for updating
*   find() for fetching
*   remove() for deleting
*   createQuery() for executing JPQL

All method implementation done by hibernate who actually talks to DB.

  

**→ EntityManager interface methods are implemented by JPA Vendors like Hibernate \[SessionImpl\] etc.**

→ **EntityManagerFactory helps to create an object of EntityManger**

  

**So you can ask question, why we are interacting with JPA repository, why we can't directly interact with Entity Manager.**

  

*   Internally using EntityManger API only, but it provides some predefined methods like findAll, deleteAll etc.
*   Also provides pagination and sorting capability.
*   Also @Transactional support on operations which needs it on operations like insert, modify, delete .
*   Start and close EntityManager resource, so, no need to mange it.

  
  

**PersistenceContext**

*   Consider its a first level cache.
*   For each EntityManager, PersistenceContext object is created, which hold list of entities its working on.
*   Also mange the life cycle of entity.

  
  

Entity Manager Insert-Update-Delete operations are Transaction bounded. Means, it first check if **transaction** is open, if not it will throw exception.

  

But not all \[ READ operations are not transaction bounded \]
