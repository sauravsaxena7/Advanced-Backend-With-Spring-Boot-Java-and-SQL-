# 1. SOLID PRINCIPLES

**SOLID PRICIPLES OF OOPS**

**S - Single Responsibility Principles**

**O - Open / Closed Principles**

**L - Liskov Substitution Principle**

**I - Interface Segmented Principle**

**D - Dependency Inversion Principle**

  

**Advantage:**

Help us to write better code:

*   Avoid Duplicate code
*   Easy to maintain
*   Easy to understand
*   Flexible Software
*   Reduce Complexity

  

1. **S - Single Responsibility Principles**
*   A class should have only one reason to change

  

```java
class Marker{
    String name;
    String color;
    int year;
    int price;
    public Marker(String name, String color, int year,int price){
        this.color=color;
        this.name=name;
        this.price=price;
        this.year=year;
    }
}


```

  
  

Invoice **HAS A RELATIONSHIP** WITH Marker

  

```java
class Invoice{
    private Marker marker;
    private int quantity;

    public Invoice( Marker marker,int quantity){
        this.marker = marker;
        this.quantity=quantity;
    }

    public int calculatePrice(){
        return ((marker.price)*this.quantity);
    }

    public void printInvoice(){
        //print invoice
    }

    public void saveToDB(){
        //Save the data into DB
    }
}
```

  

**No. of reason to change Invoice class.**

*   if we want to change the logic of total price calculation, let's we Introduce GST here
*   if we want to change the logic of print invoice.
*   Let's we want to change the logic of saving data from DB to file

  

But Single responsibility Says one reason to change class .

  

So, Let's break invoice into following single responsibility chain

  

```cpp
class Invoice{
    private Marker marker;
    private int quantity;

    public Invoice( Marker marker,int quantity){
        this.marker = marker;
        this.quantity=quantity;
    }

    public int calculatePrice(){
        return ((marker.price)*this.quantity);
    }
    
}
```

  

```cpp
class InvoicePrinter{
    private Marker marker;

    public InvoicePrinter( Marker marker){
        this.marker = marker;
    }


    public void printInvoice(){
        //print invoice
    }

}
```

  
  

```cpp
class InvoiceDao{
    private Marker marker;

    public InvoiceDao( Marker marker){
        this.marker = marker;
    }


    public void saveToDB(){
        //Save the data into DB
    }
}
```

  

**Now every class has single responsibility and single reason to change.**

  
  

**2\. O - Open / Closed Principles**

*   Open for extension but closed for modification

  

```cpp
class InvoiceDao{
    private Marker marker;

    public InvoiceDao( Marker marker){
        this.marker = marker;
    }


    public void saveToDB(){
        //Save the data into DB
    }
    
    public void saveToFile(String filename){
        //Save invoice in the file with the given name
    }
}
```

  

**Is this class following the open closed principles. = NO**

*   Open for extension, you can extend it, but you cannot modify it.

  
  

```typescript
interface InvoiceDao{
    void save(Invoice invoice);
}

class DatabaseInvoiceDao implements InvoiceDao{

    @Override
    public void save(Invoice invoice) {
        //Save invoice in the DB with the given name
    }
}

class FileSaverInvoiceDao implements InvoiceDao{

    @Override
    public void save(Invoice invoice) {
        //Save invoice in the File with the given name
    }
}
```

  
  

**3\. L - Liskov Substitution Principle**

*   If Class B is subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace object of A with B without breaking the behavior of the program .

**Subclass should extend the capacity of parent class not narrow it down.**

  

```typescript
interface Bike{
    void turnOnEngine();
    void accelerate();
}

class MotorCycle implements Bike{

    boolean isEngineOn;
    int speed;

    @Override
    public void turnOnEngine() {
        //turn on the engine
        isEngineOn=true;
    }

    @Override
    public void accelerate() {
        //increase the speed
        speed=speed+10;
    }
}

class Bicycle implements Bike{

    @Override
    public void turnOnEngine() {
        throw new AssertionError("there is no engine");
    }

    @Override
    public void accelerate() {
        //do something
    }
}
```

  

**In Bicycle we change the behavior , but after extension , we narrow it down it's properties because bicycle doesn't have engine.**

  

**Let's take another example.**

```java
class Vehicle{
    public Integer getNumberOfWheels(){
        return 2;
    }

    public Boolean hasEngine(){
        return true;
    }
}

class MotorCycle extends Vehicle{
}

class Car extends Vehicle{
    @Override
    public Integer getNumberOfWheels() {
        return 4;
    }
    
}
```

  

*   Implement those methods that is needed to be implement.

  

Now we down grade the property of vehicle class.

  

```scala
class BiCycle extends Vehicle{
    @Override
    public Boolean hasEngine() {
        return null;
    }
}
```

  
  
  

```java
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        List<Vehicle> vehicleList = new ArrayList<>();
        vehicleList.add(new MotorCycle());
        vehicleList.add(new Car());
        vehicleList.add(new Bicycle());
        for(Vehicle vehicle: vehicleList){
            System.out.println(vehicle.hasEngine().toString());
        //throw nullpointer exception for class Bicycle
        }
    }
}
```

  

**Solution for the problem**

*   In vehicle class try to put very generic class.
*   which can easily acceptable by every class

  

```scala
class Vehicle{
    public Integer getNumberOfWheels(){
        return 2;
    }


}

class EngineVehicle extends Vehicle{
    public Boolean hasEngine(){
        return true;
    }

}

class MotorCycle extends EngineVehicle{

    @Override
    public Boolean hasEngine() {
        return super.hasEngine();
    }
}

class Car extends EngineVehicle{

    @Override
    public Integer getNumberOfWheels() {
        return 4;
    }

}

class BiCycle extends Vehicle{
}
```

  
  

```cs
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        List<Vehicle> vehicleList = new ArrayList<>();
        vehicleList.add(new MotorCycle());
        vehicleList.add(new Car());
        vehicleList.add(new Bicycle());
        for(Vehicle vehicle: vehicleList){
            System.out.println(vehicle.getNumberOfWheels().toString());

        }
    }
}
```

  
  

```cs
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        List<EngileVehicle> vehicleList = new ArrayList<>();
        vehicleList.add(new MotorCycle());
        vehicleList.add(new Car());
        for(Vehicle vehicle: vehicleList){
            System.out.println(vehicle.hasEngine().toString());

        }
    }
}
```

  

  

**4\. I - Interface Segmented Principle**

*   Interfaces should be such, that client should implement unnecessary functions they do not need.
*   Interface should break into small pieces so, client should implement unnecessary functions they do not need

  

```less
interface RestaurantEmployee {
    void washDishes();
    void serveCustomers();
    void cookFood();
}

class Waiter implements RestaurantEmployee{

    @Override
    public void washDishes() {
        //not my job
    }

    @Override
    public void serveCustomers() {
        //serving customer
    }

    @Override
    public void cookFood() {
        //not my job
    }
}
```

  

let's, make it to interface segmented principle.

  

```java
interface Chef {
    void cookFood();
    void decideMenu();
}

interface WaiterInterface {
    void serveCustomers();
    void takeOrders();
}


class Waiters implements WaiterInterface{


    @Override
    public void serveCustomers() {
        //serving customer
    }

    @Override
    public void takeOrders() {
        //managing orders
    }
}
```

  
  

**5\. D - Dependency Inversion Principle**

*   Class should depends on interfaces rather than concrete class

  

KeyBoard <<Interface>>

*   Wired keyboard
*   Bluetooth keyword

  

Mouse<<Interface>>

*   Wired Mouse
*   Bluetooth Mouse

  
  

```less
class MacBook {
  private final WiredKeyboard keyboard;
  private final WiredMouse mouse;
  
  public MacBook() {
    keyboard = new WiredKeyboard();
    mouse = new WiredMouse();
  }
}
```

  
  

After correction

*   depend up on interface , not depend up on concrete class

  

```cpp
class MacBook {
  private final keyboard keyboard;
  private final Mouse mouse;
  
  public MacBook(keyboard keyboard,Mouse mouse) {
    this.keyboard = keyboard;
    this.mouse = mouse;
  }
}
```
