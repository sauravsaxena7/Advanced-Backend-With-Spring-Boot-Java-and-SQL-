# 2. Strategy Design Pattern (Behavioral Design Pattern)

**is-a relation = inheritance**

has-a relation = using their object

*   It is fine when we are using parent class capability used in child class capability .
*   But when two child class has same capability but it's different from their parent class , they need to maintain same code implementation in both the child. which is case of duplicate code.

  

```cs
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withoutStrategyPattern;

public class Vehicle {
    public void drive(){
        System.out.println("Normal drive capability");
    }
}
```

  

```scala
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withoutStrategyPattern;

public class SportsVehicle extends Vehicle{

    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Sports drive capability");
        //same code impl
    }
}
```

  

```scala
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withoutStrategyPattern;

public class OffRoadsVehicle extends Vehicle{
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Sports drive capability");
        //same code impl
    }
}
```

  
  

```scala
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withoutStrategyPattern;

public class PassengerVehicle extends Vehicle{
}
```

  

```scala
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withoutStrategyPattern;

public class GoodsVehicle extends Vehicle {
}
```

*   To solve the problem we need a strategy to maintain the Simple Drive and Special Drive Capability.

  

```java
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withStrategyDesignPattern;

public interface DriveStrategy {
    public void drive();
}
```

  

```java
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withStrategyDesignPattern;

public class NormalDriveStrategy implements DriveStrategy {

    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Normal Drive Capability");

    }
}
```

  

```java
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withStrategyDesignPattern;

public class SportsDriveStrategy implements DriveStrategy{
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Sports Drive Capability");
    }
}
```

  

```java
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withStrategyDesignPattern;

public class XYZDriveStrategy implements DriveStrategy{

    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("XYZ DRIVE Capability");
    }
}
```

  

```java
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withStrategyDesignPattern;

public class Vehicle {
    DriveStrategy driveStrategy;
    public  Vehicle(DriveStrategy driveStrategy){
        this.driveStrategy=driveStrategy;
    }

    public void drive(){
        driveStrategy.drive();
    }
}
```

  
  

```scala
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withStrategyDesignPattern;

public class SportsVehicle extends Vehicle{
    public SportsVehicle() {
        super(new SportsDriveStrategy());
    }
}
```

  

```scala
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withStrategyDesignPattern;

public class OffRoadVehicle extends Vehicle{

    public OffRoadVehicle() {
        super(new SportsDriveStrategy());
    }
}
```

  
  

```scala
package LLD.design_patterns.Behavioral_Design_Pattern.strategy_design_patterns.withStrategyDesignPattern;

public class GoodsVehicle extends Vehicle{
    public GoodsVehicle() {
        super(new NormalDriveStrategy());
    }
}
```
