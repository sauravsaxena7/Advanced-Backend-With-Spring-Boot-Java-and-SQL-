# 18. Adapter Pattern (Structural Design Pattern)

  
  

**Expected Interface ←------Adapter act as a BRIDGE------→Existing Interface**

  

**Client**

|

**|**

<<Adapter Interface>>

request();

IS-A Relation |----HAS-A Relation----------<<Existing Interface >>

| | Adapter

Concrete Adapter Implementation

request() {----}

  

1. **Power Adapter & Socket**
*   If you have 3 -pin socket you cannot insert 2 pin power adapter.
*   so, in that case Adapter design comes into picture, it will make a wrapper or adapter of 3-pin act like a bridge socket and make it to 2-pin.

  

1. **XML TO JSON Parser**

  

CLIENT\[want json\]--------→ ADAPTER\[XML TO JSON\] ←--------XML\[XML SOURCE\]

  
  

1. **WEIGHT MACHINE return in PONDS**
*   Client want's weight in kg
*   Adapter will help to make it possible.

  

**Adapter interface expose all method which client understand**

  

**Example :**

  

```java
package LLD.design_patterns.Structural_Design_Pattern.adapter_design_pattern;

public interface WeightMachine {
    public double getWeightInPound();
}
```

  

```java
package LLD.design_patterns.Structural_Design_Pattern.adapter_design_pattern;

public class WeightMachineForBabies implements WeightMachine{
    @Override
    public double getWeightInPound() {
        return 20;
    }
}
```

  

```java
package LLD.design_patterns.Structural_Design_Pattern.adapter_design_pattern.adapter;

public interface WeightMachineAdapter {
    double getWeightInKg();
}
```

  

```java
package LLD.design_patterns.Structural_Design_Pattern.adapter_design_pattern.adapter;

import LLD.design_patterns.Structural_Design_Pattern.adapter_design_pattern.WeightMachine;

public class WeightMachineAdapterImpl implements WeightMachineAdapter{
    WeightMachine weightMachine;
    public WeightMachineAdapterImpl(WeightMachine weightMachine){
        this.weightMachine=weightMachine;
    }


    @Override
    public double getWeightInKg() {
        return weightMachine.getWeightInPound() *.45;
    }
}
```

  

```plain
package LLD.design_patterns.Structural_Design_Pattern.adapter_design_pattern;


import LLD.design_patterns.Structural_Design_Pattern.adapter_design_pattern.adapter.WeightMachineAdapter;
import LLD.design_patterns.Structural_Design_Pattern.adapter_design_pattern.adapter.WeightMachineAdapterImpl;

public class AdapterMain {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        WeightMachineAdapter weightMachineAdapter = new WeightMachineAdapterImpl(new WeightMachineForBabies());
        System.out.println(weightMachineAdapter.getWeightInKg());
    }

}

output
9.0
